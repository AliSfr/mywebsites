        <p> The author, (Sir) Arthur Conan-Doyle wrote his first Holmes story, A Study In Scarlet, in 1886. Sherlock
          Holmes, a fictitious character was based on a real man, Dr Joseph Bell, a renown forensic scientist at
          Edinburgh University whom
          Conan-Doyle studied under. Conan-Doyle wrote 56 self contained short stories & 4 novels (60 adventures in
          total) The collection is known as The Cannon.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The first Sherlock Holmes film was produced in 1900. In 1939 the novels were developed as a series of films
          staring Basil Rathbone, establishing the trademark deerstalker, pipe & spyglass as a global visual icon.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Conan Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six short stories that feature Holmes. The first two stories, short
          novels appeared in Beeton’s Christmas Annual for 1887 and Lippincott’s Monthly Magazine in 1890,
          respectively.The character grew
          tremendously in popularity with the beginning of the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine in
          1891; further series of short stories and two serialised novels appeared until 1927. The stories cover a
          period from around 1878 up
          to 1907, with a final case in 1914.All b ut four stories are narrated by Holmes’s friend and biographer, Dr
          John H. Watson; two are narrated by Sherlock Holmes himself, and two others are written in the third
          person.Conan Doyle said that
          the character of Holmes was inspired by Dr Joseph Bell, for whom Doyle had worked as a clerk at the Edinburgh
          Royal Infirmary. Like Sherlock Holmes, Bell was noted for drawing large conclusions from the smallest
          observations. Michael
          Harrison has argued in a 1971 article in Ellery Queen’s Mystery Magazine that the character was inspired by
          Wendell Scherer a “consulting detective” in a murder case that allegedly received a great deal of newspaper
          attention in England in
          1882.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Perhaps one of the quirkiest twenty first-century homages to Holmes belongs to the award-winning American TV
          series House, which began transmitting in 2004, starring the British actor, Hugh Laurie. Now into his fifth
          season, Dr Gregory
          House is in many respects a medical Sherlock Holmes, and series creator, David Shore, has admitted that even
          Dr House name is meant as a subtle homage. The show draws heavily upon Holmes archetypes, such as House
          reliance on psychology to
          solve a case, his reluctance to accept cases he does not find interesting, his drug addiction (Vicodin instead
          of cocaine), his home address (apartment 221B), a complete disregard for social mores, personal talents
          (playing piano and
          guitar, rather like Holmes violin), as well as Holmes characteristic ability to judge a situation correctly
          with almost no effort. Dr House confidant and sounding board is Dr James Wilson.</p>
